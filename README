I had a bad SimpleNote client delete a bunch of my notes, and then when I
restored them, it created a whole lot of duplicates. Or maybe it wasn't a bad
client, maybe it was user error -- regardless, I'll blame the software since
it can't defend itself. So I needed to de-dupe all my notes.

As it happens, I had been wanting to write a SimpleNotes tag to hashtag /
hashtag to SimpleNotes tag program already. I'd also been wanting to play with
Mongo a bit.

So I took advantage of all of this, and put together my SimpleNotes Swiss Army
Knife. It's PHP and comes with a command-line example.

I slapped an MIT-license on it. If Simperium, Inc objects to that license,
I'll happily change it to whatever is appropriate. You can get the code at
